# **Highly Scalable & Secure Static Website Hosting on AWS**

## **Project Overview**
This project involves hosting a **secure, scalable, and high-performance** smart static website using AWS services. The website is stored in **Amazon S3**, distributed globally via **CloudFront**, and secured using **AWS WAF**. Additionally, **Amazon Kinesis** is integrated for real-time analytics, while **AWS CloudWatch** monitors performance, logs, and sets up alerts. **AWS Lambda** automates tasks and enhances functionality.

## **Architecture & Components**

1. **Amazon S3** â€“ Serves as the primary storage for the static website files, ensuring durability and scalability.  
2. **Amazon CloudFront** â€“ A content delivery network (CDN) to distribute website content globally with low latency.  
3. **AWS WAF** â€“ Protects the website from common web threats like SQL injection and DDoS attacks.  
4. **Amazon Kinesis** â€“ Captures and processes real-time user interactions for analytics and insights.  
5. **AWS CloudWatch** â€“  
   - **Logs:** Stores and analyzes access logs, error logs, and performance data.  
   - **Alarms:** Triggers alerts based on website traffic, errors, or security incidents.  
6. **AWS Lambda** â€“ Automates backend processes such as log processing, security rule updates, and event-driven tasks.  

## **Key Features & Benefits**
 **Scalability:** Serverless architecture ensures automatic scaling to handle variable traffic.  
 **Security:** AWS WAF safeguards against threats, and CloudFront provides DDoS protection.  
 **Performance:** Low-latency content delivery with CloudFrontâ€™s global edge locations.  
 **Monitoring & Automation:** CloudWatch provides real-time logs and alerts, while Lambda automates tasks.  
 **Data Processing:** Kinesis captures and analyzes user activity for insights.  

## **Use Cases**
- Hosting marketing websites, blogs, and product landing pages.  
- Secure and cost-effective alternative to traditional web servers.  
- Real-time analytics to track website performance and user engagement.  

## **Setup & Deployment**
To deploy this project on AWS, follow these steps:

1. **Create an S3 Bucket** and enable static website hosting.  
2. **Set up CloudFront** and configure it to use the S3 bucket as the origin.  
3. **Enable AWS WAF** and define security rules.  
4. **Integrate Amazon Kinesis** for real-time analytics (optional).  
5. **Configure AWS CloudWatch** for logging and monitoring.  
6. **Deploy AWS Lambda functions** to automate required processes.
